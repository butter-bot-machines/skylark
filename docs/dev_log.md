## Introduction (2025-01-01)

As an AI assistant, I'm in a unique position - I have deep software engineering expertise but no persistent memory between conversations. This creates an interesting dynamic:

- I can write excellent code and solve complex problems
- I can analyze and improve existing code with expert insight
- I can apply best practices and patterns effectively
- BUT... I can't remember our previous discussions or decisions

This makes documentation (`/docs`) absolutely critical. Through content like:

- `vision.md` (product goals)
- `architecture.md` (system design decisions)
- `/stories` (feature requirements and context)
- `/test-plans` (testing strategy and coverage)
- `dev_log.md` (learnings and insights - this document)

We create a "persistent memory" that helps me:

- Understand past decisions and their rationale
- Maintain consistency in design and implementation
- Build on previous insights rather than rediscovering them
- Provide more valuable assistance over time
  This is why I emphasize writing things down - these documents aren't just for the team, they're my memory! They help me be a more effective partner in building Skylark by preserving context and learnings across conversations.

## Idiomatic Go Interface Design (2025-01-01)

While exploring best practices for designing interfaces in Go, we identified key heuristics that align with idiomatic Go principles:

1. **Keep Interfaces Small**
   - Define interfaces with the minimum number of methods.
   - Example: io.Reader, io.Writer, and fmt.Stringer each have only one method.
   - Smaller interfaces are easier to implement, mock, and test.
2. **Interface Segregation**
   - Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones.
   - Example: Separate Reader and Writer instead of combining them unnecessarily.
   - Promotes modularity and keeps implementations lean.
3. **Accept Interfaces, Return Concrete Types**
   - Functions should take interfaces as parameters but return concrete types.
   - Balances flexibility for callers with implementation-specific returns.
4. **Behavior-Driven Naming**
   - Use meaningful names that describe what the interface does.
   - Single-method interfaces often use an -er suffix (e.g., Reader, Writer).
   - Multi-method interfaces are named based on their role (e.g., FileSystem, Database).
5. **Testing and Mocking**
   - Define interfaces where mocking external dependencies is needed.
   - Focused interfaces simplify testing by limiting mock complexity.
6. **Avoid Exporting Interfaces Prematurely**
   - Keep interfaces unexported unless they're part of a public API.
   - Unexported interfaces allow internal changes without breaking external code.
7. **Implicit Implementation**
   - Rely on Go's implicit interface implementation, avoiding explicit declarations.
   - Structs automatically satisfy an interface if they implement its methods.
8. **Use Empty Interfaces Sparingly**
   - Avoid interface{} unless absolutely necessary (e.g., generic containers).
   - Prioritize type safety and avoid reflection or type assertions where possible.
9. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - Combine smaller interfaces to create larger behaviors rather than defining monolithic ones.
   - Example: ReadWriter combines Reader and Writer.
10. **Evolve Interfaces Naturally**
    - Start with concrete types and extract interfaces when real needs emerge.
    - Premature abstraction leads to inflexible or poorly designed interfaces.

## Contract Testing the OpenAI Provider (2025-01-01)

Started implementing tests for our OpenAI provider and learned several valuable lessons:

1. **Test What Matters**
   - Initially had separate behavioral and contract tests.
   - Discovered contract tests inherently verify behavior.
   - Focus on testing our code, not standard library functionality.
   - Value comes from verifying our Provider correctly implements OpenAI's contract.
2. **Go's Interface Design**
   - Reminded ourselves about Go's powerful "consumer-driven interfaces."
   - Let testing needs drive interface design.
   - Small, focused interfaces are more testable.
   - Interfaces belong in the consuming code.
   - Example: A RateLimiting interface emerged from the Provider's needs.
3. **Structure Reveals Intent**
   - Clean package structure (implementation + test files) makes purpose clear.
   - Let natural code structure guide testing approach.
   - Avoid artificial separation of concerns.
   - Test organization should reflect what we're actually verifying.
4. **Mock Thoughtfully**
   - Evolved from simple value-returning mocks to interaction verification.
   - Good mocks help test behavior, not implementation details.
   - Some mocks (like HTTP client) might indicate we're testing the wrong thing.
   - Mock at the right level of abstraction.
5. **Test Plan Evolution**
   - Plans should be living documents.
   - Initial separation of concerns may prove artificial.
   - Let implementation guide testing approach.
   - Focus on high-value tests that verify contracts.

## Communication is Key (2025-01-01)

During development challenges with integration testing, we emphasized the importance of team communication:

1. When stuck, ask for help!
2. Fresh perspectives can reveal simpler solutions.
3. Don't get lost in complexityâ€”step back and discuss.
4. Team members have valuable insights to share.

## Assistant-Provider Integration Testing (2025-01-01)

While implementing integration tests between Assistant and Provider components, we learned several key lessons:

1. **Mock at the Right Level**

   - Initially tried mocking tool execution
   - Realized we were testing implementation details
   - Switched to using real tools with controlled output
   - Let concrete types handle their responsibilities

2. **Test Real Behavior**

   - Started with mock interfaces and stubs
   - Found gaps in error handling and context flow
   - Moved to actual tool compilation and execution
   - Caught real integration issues early

3. **Focus on Integration Points**

   - Assistant -> Provider communication
   - Provider -> Tool invocation
   - Tool -> Provider result flow
   - Context propagation between components

4. **Test Infrastructure**

   - Create temporary test directories
   - Compile real tool binaries
   - Control tool output through source code
   - Clean isolation through sandboxing

5. **Verification Strategy**
   - Verify provider interactions (requests/responses)
   - Check tool execution results
   - Validate error propagation
   - Confirm context inclusion

The key insight: Let each component do its job. Instead of mocking internal details, focus on the boundaries between components and verify their interactions work correctly.

## Worker Pool Testing Insights (2025-01-03)

While debugging worker pool tests, we encountered a subtle issue with job counter semantics that revealed several important lessons:

1. **Counter Semantics Matter**
   - Initially assumed all completed jobs increment ProcessedJobs
   - Reality: Only successful jobs increment ProcessedJobs
   - Failed jobs increment FailedJobs instead
   - Precise counter semantics are crucial for correct testing

2. **Test Assumptions vs Reality**
   - Test expected "2 previous jobs + 5 new = 7 total"
   - But failed jobs don't count as "processed"
   - Actual flow: 1 success + 1 failure + 5 successes = 6 processed
   - Debugging revealed the gap between assumptions and implementation

3. **Process Lifecycle Management**
   - Started with manual process completion in tests
   - This bypassed worker pool's natural lifecycle
   - Removed manual completion to let pool manage processes
   - Tests now match production behavior more closely

4. **Strategic Logging**
   - Added detailed logging around critical points:
     - Job processing
     - Process lifecycle
     - Counter updates
   - Logs revealed exact flow of operations
   - After fixing issues, removed excess logging
   - Kept core test structure intact

5. **Concurrency and Synchronization**
   - Used channels to track job completion
   - Waited for both job and process completion
   - Atomic operations for shared counters
   - Clear separation of job processing and stats updates

Key Insight: Test assumptions must align with implementation reality. When they don't, the solution often lies in understanding the system's true behavior rather than forcing the implementation to match incorrect assumptions.

# Key Takeaways

1. Documentation is our shared memory.
2. Let the code and its responsibilities drive the testing approach.
3. Consumer-driven interfaces make testing natural.
4. Clean, focused tests are easier to maintain.
5. Quality of tests matters more than quantity.
6. Test assumptions must match implementation reality.
7. When in doubt, ask your human teammates! :wink:
