# Simplify Command Processing (âœ“ Completed)

> Completed on January 3, 2024 at 23:15
> - Removed special handling of `-!` prefix
> - Simplified command detection to just `!`
> - Updated tests to verify simpler behavior
> - Reduced code complexity

The system was treating `-!` as a special "invalidated command" state that needed tracking, when it should simply treat it as regular text. Only `!` should be treated as a command marker.

## Changes Made

1. pkg/parser/parser.go:
   - Removed special error for `-!` lines
   - Only parse lines starting with `!`
   - Simplified command detection logic

2. pkg/processor/concrete/processor.go:
   - Removed special handling of `-!`
   - Only process commands starting with `!`
   - After processing, change `!` to `-!` to make it not a command
   - Simplified file handling to only check for `!`

3. test/integration/integration_test.go:
   - Updated tests to verify only `!` is treated as command
   - Verified `-!` is treated as regular text
   - Verified command invalidation works correctly

## Implementation Details

1. Simplified parser to only care about `!`:
   ```go
   func (p *Parser) ParseCommand(line string) (*Command, error) {
       if !strings.HasPrefix(line, "!") {
           return nil, nil // Not a command
       }
       // Parse command...
   }
   ```

2. Simplified processor to only process `!`:
   ```go
   // Only commands start with !
   if strings.HasPrefix(line, "!") {
       // Process command...
       line = strings.Replace(line, "!", "-!", 1)
   }
   ```

## Verification

All tests pass:
- pkg/processor/concrete/processor_test.go
- pkg/parser/parser_test.go
- pkg/assistant/integration_test.go
- pkg/watcher/concrete/watcher_test.go
- test/integration/integration_test.go

## Result

The system now has a simpler and more predictable command processing model:
1. Lines starting with `!` are commands to process
2. All other lines (including `-!`) are just text
3. After processing a command, change `!` to `-!` to make it not a command
4. No special handling or tracking of processed commands needed
