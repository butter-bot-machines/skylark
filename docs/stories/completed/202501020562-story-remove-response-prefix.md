# Remove Response Prefix (âœ“ Completed)

> Completed on January 3, 2025 at 23:15
> - Removed `>` prefix from processor
> - Removed "Response: " prefix from mock provider
> - Updated all tests to expect raw responses
> - Simplified response handling across system

The system was adding presentation-specific prefixes to responses:
1. The processor added a `>` prefix when writing responses to files
2. Tests expected this `>` prefix in their assertions
3. The mock provider added a "Response: " prefix to its responses

This mixed presentation concerns with core behavior. The core system should just handle raw responses without any formatting.

## Changes Made

1. pkg/processor/concrete/processor.go:
   - Removed `>` prefix when writing responses
   - Updated response handling to use raw responses
   - Simplified UpdateFile method to not look for prefixes

2. pkg/processor/concrete/processor_test.go:
   - Updated test data to not expect `>` prefix
   - Updated expected response format
   - Verified raw response handling

3. test/integration/integration_test.go:
   - Updated response verification to not expect `>` prefix
   - Updated test data and assertions
   - Verified file content matches raw responses

4. pkg/processor/concrete/mock_provider.go:
   - Removed "Response: " prefix from mock responses
   - Updated to return raw response content
   - Simplified response generation

## Implementation Details

1. First updated mock provider to return raw responses:
   ```go
   // For testing, return raw response
   return "test", nil
   ```

2. Then updated processor to not add `>` prefix:
   ```go
   // Add response without prefix
   newLines = append(newLines, response)
   ```

3. Then updated all tests to expect raw responses:
   ```go
   expected := "test"
   if response != expected {
       t.Errorf("Expected %q, got %q", expected, response)
   }
   ```

## Verification

All tests pass:
- pkg/processor/concrete/processor_test.go
- pkg/parser/parser_test.go
- pkg/assistant/integration_test.go
- pkg/watcher/concrete/watcher_test.go
- test/integration/integration_test.go

## Result

The system now handles responses as raw text without any formatting prefixes, making it simpler and more consistent. This properly separates core behavior from presentation concerns.
