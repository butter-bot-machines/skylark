# Story: Implement Processor Abstraction (✓ Completed)

## Status
Completed on January 3, 2025 at 20:08
- Defined processor interfaces
- Implemented concrete types
- Added comprehensive tests
- Moved implementations to concrete package

## Context
The command processor system was tightly coupled with its concrete implementation, making it difficult to test and extend. Components like command processing, file handling, and response management needed to be abstracted behind interfaces.

## Goal
Create a clean separation between processor interfaces and their implementations to improve testability, maintainability, and extensibility of the command processing system.

## Requirements
1. Define clear interfaces for all processor components
2. Move concrete implementations to separate package
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Support mocking for tests

## Technical Changes

1. Interfaces:
- Created CommandProcessor interface for command handling
- Created FileProcessor interface for file operations
- Created ResponseHandler interface for response management
- Created ProcessManager interface for coordination
- Created Factory interface for processor creation

2. Concrete Implementations:
- Moved processor to concrete/processor.go
- Added proper error handling
- Added input validation
- Added mock provider for testing

3. Tests:
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Added mock implementations
- Added error case coverage
- Added file handling tests

## Success Criteria
1. All processor components have clear interfaces
2. Concrete implementations are isolated
3. Tests pass and cover edge cases
4. Existing code continues to work
5. New components can be easily mocked

## Non-Goals
1. Changing processing behavior
2. Modifying command format
3. Adding new processing features
4. Changing configuration format

## Future Considerations
1. Additional processor providers
2. Enhanced command validation
3. More granular response control
4. Custom processing strategies

## Testing Plan
1. Unit Tests:
   - Interface implementations
   - Error handling
   - Command processing
   - File handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - Component interaction
   - Command propagation
   - Error handling
   - Configuration handling

3. Migration Tests:
   - Existing code compatibility
   - Configuration compatibility
   - Error handling
   - Command handling

## Risks
1. Breaking changes in interfaces
2. Performance impact
3. File system implications
4. Migration complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interface Usage:
```go
type CommandProcessor interface {
    Process(cmd *parser.Command) (string, error)
}

type FileProcessor interface {
    ProcessFile(path string) error
    ProcessDirectory(dir string) error
}

type ResponseHandler interface {
    HandleResponse(cmd *parser.Command, response string) error
    UpdateFile(path string, responses []Response) error
}

type ProcessManager interface {
    FileProcessor
    CommandProcessor
    ResponseHandler
    GetProcessManager() process.Manager
}
```

2. Implementation Structure:
```
pkg/processor/
├── interface.go
└── concrete/
    ├── processor.go
    ├── mock_provider.go
    └── processor_test.go
```

3. Error Handling:
- Clear error types
- Proper error wrapping
- Consistent messaging
- Event logging

4. Command Management:
- Command validation
- Response handling
- File updates
- Directory processing
