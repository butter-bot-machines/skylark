# Core Entity Coupling Analysis (✓ Completed)

> Completed on January 3, 2024 at 23:20
> - Analyzed coupling in all core components
> - Identified required interfaces
> - Generated implementation stories
> - All implementation stories completed

This analysis identified coupling points in core components and defined the interfaces needed to decouple them. All implementation stories generated from this analysis have been completed.

## Analysis Results

### Core Infrastructure Layer

1. File Watcher (pkg/watcher) ✓
   - Now uses filesystem abstraction
   - Uses event notification system
   - Uses debouncer interface
   - Uses job queue interface

2. Job Queue (pkg/worker) ✓
   - Uses queue interface
   - Uses synchronization primitives
   - Uses worker interface

3. Worker Pool (pkg/worker) ✓
   - Uses process manager interface
   - Uses resource controller interface
   - Uses job queue interface
   - Uses processor interface

4. Command Processor (pkg/processor) ✓
   - Uses tool manager interface
   - Uses provider interface
   - Uses assistant manager interface
   - Uses process manager interface

3. Worker Pool (202401020559) ✓
   - Job queue
   - Resource management
   - Process control

4. File Watcher (202401020560) ✓
   - Event handling
   - Debouncing
   - Path management

5. Core Decoupling (202401020561) ✓

## Result

The analysis successfully identified coupling points and generated implementation stories that have now been completed. The system has been decoupled with proper abstractions and interfaces in place.
