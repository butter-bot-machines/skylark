# Story: Implement Watcher Abstraction (✓ Completed)

## Status
Completed on January 3, 2025 at 19:50
- Defined watcher interfaces
- Implemented concrete types
- Added comprehensive tests
- Moved implementations to concrete package

## Context
The file watcher system was tightly coupled with its concrete implementation, making it difficult to test and extend. Components like event handling, debouncing, and path management needed to be abstracted behind interfaces.

## Goal
Create a clean separation between watcher interfaces and their implementations to improve testability, maintainability, and extensibility of the file watching system.

## Requirements
1. Define clear interfaces for all watcher components
2. Move concrete implementations to separate package
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Support mocking for tests

## Technical Changes

1. Interfaces:
- Created EventHandler interface for event processing
- Created Debouncer interface for event coalescing
- Created PathManager interface for path tracking
- Created FileWatcher interface for coordination
- Created Factory interface for watcher creation

2. Concrete Implementations:
- Moved watcher to concrete/watcher.go
- Moved debouncer to concrete/debouncer.go
- Added proper error handling
- Added event validation

3. Tests:
- Moved tests to concrete package
- Updated to use interfaces
- Added new test cases
- Improved error coverage

## Success Criteria
1. All watcher components have clear interfaces
2. Concrete implementations are isolated
3. Tests pass and cover edge cases
4. Existing code continues to work
5. New components can be easily mocked

## Non-Goals
1. Changing watching behavior
2. Modifying event types
3. Adding new watching features
4. Changing configuration format

## Future Considerations
1. Additional watcher providers
2. Enhanced event filtering
3. More granular path control
4. Custom debouncing strategies

## Testing Plan
1. Unit Tests:
   - Interface implementations
   - Error handling
   - Event debouncing
   - Path validation

2. Integration Tests:
   - Component interaction
   - Event propagation
   - Error handling
   - Configuration handling

3. Migration Tests:
   - Existing code compatibility
   - Configuration compatibility
   - Error handling
   - Event handling

## Risks
1. Breaking changes in interfaces
2. Performance impact
3. File system implications
4. Migration complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interface Usage:
```go
type FileWatcher interface {
    Stop() error
}

type EventHandler interface {
    HandleEvent(path string) error
}

type Debouncer interface {
    Debounce(key string, fn func())
    Stop()
}

type PathManager interface {
    AddPath(path string) error
    RemovePath(path string) error
    IsWatched(path string) bool
}
```

2. Implementation Structure:
```
pkg/watcher/
├── interface.go
└── concrete/
    ├── watcher.go
    ├── debouncer.go
    └── watcher_test.go
```

3. Error Handling:
- Clear error types
- Proper error wrapping
- Consistent messaging
- Event logging

4. Event Management:
- File change events
- Path validation
- Event debouncing
- Handler routing
