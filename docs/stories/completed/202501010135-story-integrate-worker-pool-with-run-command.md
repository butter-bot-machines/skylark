# Story: Integrate Worker Pool with Run Command (âœ“ Completed)

## Status
Completed on January 1, 2025 at 01:45
- Implemented worker pool integration
- Added progress monitoring
- Added proper logging
- Fixed completion handling

## Context
Currently, the `run` command processes files directly through the processor without resource management or progress tracking. The worker pool system already provides these capabilities for the watch command, but they're not being utilized for run.

## Goal
Integrate the run command with the worker pool system to leverage existing resource management, error handling, and progress tracking capabilities.

## Requirements
1. Files should be processed concurrently within configured limits
2. Resource usage should be controlled per worker
3. Progress should be visible to the user
4. Errors should be handled gracefully
5. Should maintain synchronous completion for CLI usage

## Technical Changes

1. Job System:
- Update FileChangeJob to use processor
- Add proper logging
- Implement error handling
- Add progress tracking

2. Run Command:
- Create worker pool
- Queue files for processing
- Monitor and display progress
- Wait for completion
- Handle errors

3. Progress Display:
- Show files queued
- Show files processed
- Show any errors
- Update at reasonable intervals

## Success Criteria
1. Running `skylark run` processes all markdown files using worker pool
2. CPU and memory usage stay within configured limits
3. Progress is displayed during processing
4. Errors are reported clearly
5. Command completes with appropriate exit code

## Non-Goals
1. Changing the watch command implementation
2. Modifying the processor's core functionality
3. Changing the file processing logic

## Future Considerations
1. Cancellation support (Ctrl+C handling)
2. More detailed progress reporting
3. Parallel directory walking
4. Priority queue for certain files

## Testing Plan
1. Unit Tests:
   - FileChangeJob with mock processor
   - Run command with mock pool
   - Progress monitoring accuracy

2. Integration Tests:
   - Multiple file processing
   - Resource limit verification
   - Error handling scenarios
   - Progress reporting accuracy

3. Performance Tests:
   - Large number of files
   - Various worker pool sizes
   - Resource limit effectiveness

## Risks
1. Potential race conditions in progress reporting
2. Memory usage with many queued files
3. Error handling complexity
4. User experience during long operations

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Command Usage:
```bash
$ skylark run
Processing files: 23 queued
[===>    ] 7/23 files processed
2 errors occurred:
  - file1.md: invalid command format
  - file2.md: assistant not found
```

2. Resource Management:
- CPU usage respects worker count
- Memory stays within limits
- Failed jobs don't block progress

3. Error Handling:
- Individual file failures logged
- Summary at completion
- Non-zero exit code on errors

4. Progress Display:
- Regular updates (2x/second)
- Clear progress indication
- Error count visible
