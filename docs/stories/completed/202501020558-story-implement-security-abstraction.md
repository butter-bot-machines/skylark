# Story: Implement Security Abstraction (✓ Completed)

## Status
Completed on January 2, 2025 at 06:00
- Defined security interfaces
- Implemented concrete types
- Added comprehensive tests
- Moved implementations to concrete package

## Context
The security system was tightly coupled with its concrete implementations, making it difficult to test and extend. Components like audit logging, file access control, and key management needed to be abstracted behind interfaces.

## Goal
Create a clean separation between security interfaces and their implementations to improve testability, maintainability, and extensibility of the security system.

## Requirements
1. Define clear interfaces for all security components
2. Move concrete implementations to separate package
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. Maintain backward compatibility
5. Support mocking for tests

## Technical Changes

1. Interfaces:
- Created EventFilter interface
- Created EventStorage interface
- Created AuditLogger interface
- Created KeyStore interface
- Created FileGuard interface
- Created ResourceGuard interface
- Created Manager interface

2. Concrete Implementations:
- Moved audit logger to concrete/audit_logger.go
- Moved file guard to concrete/file_guard.go
- Moved key store to concrete/key_store.go
- Added proper error handling
- Added resource validation

3. Tests:
- Moved tests to concrete package
- Updated to use interfaces
- Added new test cases
- Improved error coverage

## Success Criteria
1. All security components have clear interfaces
2. Concrete implementations are isolated
3. Tests pass and cover edge cases
4. Existing code continues to work
5. New components can be easily mocked

## Non-Goals
1. Changing security policies
2. Modifying validation logic
3. Adding new security features
4. Changing configuration format

## Future Considerations
1. Additional security providers
2. Enhanced audit logging
3. More granular permissions
4. Custom resource limits

## Testing Plan
1. Unit Tests:
   - Interface implementations
   - Error handling
   - Resource limits
   - Path validation

2. Integration Tests:
   - Component interaction
   - Resource management
   - Error propagation
   - Configuration handling

3. Migration Tests:
   - Existing code compatibility
   - Configuration compatibility
   - Error handling
   - Resource limits

## Risks
1. Breaking changes in interfaces
2. Performance impact
3. Security implications
4. Migration complexity

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interface Usage:
```go
type FileGuard interface {
    CheckRead(path string) error
    CheckWrite(path string) error
    AddAllowedPath(path string) error
    RemoveAllowedPath(path string)
    Close() error
}
```

2. Implementation Structure:
```
pkg/security/
├── interface.go
├── types/
│   ├── config.go
│   └── events.go
└── concrete/
    ├── audit_logger.go
    ├── file_guard.go
    └── key_store.go
```

3. Error Handling:
- Clear error types
- Proper error wrapping
- Consistent messaging
- Audit logging

4. Resource Management:
- File size limits
- Path restrictions
- Symlink controls
- Key management
