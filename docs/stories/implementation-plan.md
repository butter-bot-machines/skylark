# Testability Improvement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation order and milestones for improving testability across the codebase. The goal is to make all code testable while maintaining existing functionality.

## Stories
1. Analysis (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020546: Initial testability investigation
   - [x] 202401020548: Core coupling patterns identified
   - [x] 202401020554: Go interface best practices defined

2. Core Infrastructure:
   - [ ] 202401020553: Infrastructure Abstraction
     * Config and logging must be fixed first
     * Other components depend on these
     * Removes global state early
     * Priority: HIGH

3. Foundation Layer:
   - [ ] 202401020549: Filesystem Abstraction
     * Many components need file operations
     * Required for config and logging
     * Enables in-memory testing
     * Priority: HIGH

4. Resource Management:
   - [ ] 202401020552: Time/Resource Abstraction
     * Required for predictable tests
     * Needed by worker pool
     * Enables test determinism
     * Priority: MEDIUM

5. Process Control:
   - [ ] 202401020550: Process Abstraction
     * Depends on resource management
     * Needed for tool execution
     * Platform independence
     * Priority: MEDIUM

6. External Integration:
   - [ ] 202401020551: Provider Abstraction
     * Can be done independently
     * Improves OpenAI testing
     * Network independence
     * Priority: LOW

## Implementation Order

1. Week 1: Infrastructure
   ```
   Infrastructure Abstraction
   └── Filesystem Abstraction
   ```
   - Remove global state
   - Enable in-memory testing
   - Update affected components

2. Week 2: Resources
   ```
   Time/Resource Abstraction
   └── Process Abstraction
   ```
   - Add resource controls
   - Enable test determinism
   - Update worker pool

3. Week 3: Integration
   ```
   Provider Abstraction
   └── Final Integration
   ```
   - Network independence
   - Complete test suite
   - Verify coverage

## Milestones

1. Foundation Ready
   - [ ] Global state removed
   - [ ] File operations abstracted
   - [ ] Config/logging updated
   - [ ] Tests use memory implementations

2. Resource Control
   - [ ] Time management abstracted
   - [ ] Resource limits controlled
   - [ ] Process management isolated
   - [ ] Tests are deterministic

3. External Independence
   - [ ] Network calls abstracted
   - [ ] Provider system flexible
   - [ ] All tests passing
   - [ ] Good coverage

## Testing Strategy

1. Each Story:
   - Write tests first
   - Use small interfaces
   - Focus on behavior
   - Verify in isolation

2. Integration:
   - Test component boundaries
   - Verify interactions
   - Check error handling
   - Ensure compatibility

3. Verification:
   - Run existing tests
   - Check coverage
   - Verify performance
   - Validate behavior

## Success Criteria

1. Technical:
   - All tests pass
   - No global state
   - Good test coverage
   - Fast execution

2. Design:
   - Small interfaces
   - Clear boundaries
   - Good abstraction
   - Easy testing

3. Maintenance:
   - Clear documentation
   - Simple testing
   - Easy changes
   - No regressions

## Risks and Mitigation

1. Scope Creep:
   - Focus on testability
   - Avoid extra features
   - Clear boundaries
   - Regular reviews

2. Breaking Changes:
   - Maintain compatibility
   - Gradual migration
   - Good test coverage
   - Clear documentation

3. Complexity:
   - Small interfaces
   - Clear boundaries
   - Good abstractions
   - Simple testing

## Review Points

1. Before Each Story:
   - Check dependencies
   - Review interfaces
   - Plan testing
   - Set expectations

2. After Each Story:
   - Verify tests
   - Check coverage
   - Review design
   - Update docs

3. Major Milestones:
   - Full test suite
   - Performance check
   - Design review
   - Documentation
