# Testability Improvement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation order and milestones for improving testability across the codebase. The goal is to make all code testable while maintaining existing functionality.

## Stories
1. Analysis (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020546: Initial testability investigation
   - [x] 202401020548: Core coupling patterns identified
   - [x] 202401020554: Go interface best practices defined

2. Core Infrastructure (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020553: Infrastructure Abstraction
     * Config abstraction with memory/file implementations
     * Logging abstraction with memory/slog implementations
     * Global state removed
     * Priority: HIGH

3. Foundation Layer (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020549: Filesystem Abstraction
     * Full thread-safe memory implementation
     * All core operations implemented
     * In-memory testing enabled
     * Priority: HIGH

4. Resource Management (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020552: Time/Resource Abstraction
     * Time abstraction complete with mock/real implementations
     * Resource limits defined and working
     * Memory limits implemented with cgroups on Linux
     * Priority: MEDIUM

5. Process Control (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020550: Process Abstraction
     * Process interface defined and implemented
     * Memory and OS implementations complete
     * Platform-specific code separated
     * Resource limits working with tests
     * Priority: MEDIUM

6. External Integration (Complete):
   - [x] 202401020551: Provider Abstraction
     * Rate limiting complete
     * Tool abstraction complete
     * Error handling complete
     * HTTP client abstraction added
     * Monitoring support added
     * All tests passing
     * Priority: LOW

## Implementation Order

1. Week 1: Infrastructure
   ```
   Infrastructure Abstraction
   └── Filesystem Abstraction
   ```
   - Remove global state
   - Enable in-memory testing
   - Update affected components

2. Week 2: Resources
   ```
   Time/Resource Abstraction
   └── Process Abstraction
   ```
   - Add resource controls
   - Enable test determinism
   - Update worker pool

3. Week 3: Integration
   ```
   Provider Abstraction
   └── Final Integration
   ```
   - Network independence
   - Complete test suite
   - Verify coverage

## Milestones

1. Foundation Ready (Complete)
   - [x] Global state removed
   - [x] File operations abstracted
   - [x] Config/logging updated
   - [x] Tests use memory implementations

2. Resource Control (Complete)
   - [x] Time management abstracted
   - [x] Resource limits controlled
   - [x] Process management isolated
   - [x] Tests are deterministic

3. External Independence (Complete)
   - [x] Network calls abstracted
   - [x] Provider system flexible
   - [x] All tests passing
   - [x] Good coverage

## Testing Strategy

1. Each Story:
   - Write tests first
   - Use small interfaces
   - Focus on behavior
   - Verify in isolation

2. Integration:
   - Test component boundaries
   - Verify interactions
   - Check error handling
   - Ensure compatibility

3. Verification:
   - Run existing tests
   - Check coverage
   - Verify performance
   - Validate behavior

## Success Criteria

1. Technical:
   - All tests pass
   - No global state
   - Good test coverage
   - Fast execution

2. Design:
   - Small interfaces
   - Clear boundaries
   - Good abstraction
   - Easy testing

3. Maintenance:
   - Clear documentation
   - Simple testing
   - Easy changes
   - No regressions

## Risks and Mitigation

1. Scope Creep:
   - Focus on testability
   - Avoid extra features
   - Clear boundaries
   - Regular reviews

2. Breaking Changes:
   - Maintain compatibility
   - Gradual migration
   - Good test coverage
   - Clear documentation

3. Complexity:
   - Small interfaces
   - Clear boundaries
   - Good abstractions
   - Simple testing

## Review Points

1. Before Each Story:
   - Check dependencies
   - Review interfaces
   - Plan testing
   - Set expectations

2. After Each Story:
   - Verify tests
   - Check coverage
   - Review design
   - Update docs

3. Major Milestones:
   - Full test suite
   - Performance check
   - Design review
   - Documentation
